Advent of Code - 2015
===


I came across [Eric Wastl's](http://was.tl/) rather wonderful [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) at the perfect
time: I'd been working with *Go/Golang* for a couple of months - following *years* of PHP - and I was looking for
something to develop my skills.

The approach:

- Test-driven as much as possible.
- Take every opportunity to learn more Golang (rather than trying to crack the challenge in the shortest possible time).



Updates in 2025
---

- Moved each day into a separate package. (Previously everything was in  `main`.)
- Logic moved to objects where appropriate.
- One or two rewrites :)
