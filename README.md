Advent of Code
===


I came across [Eric Wastl's](http://was.tl/) rather wonderful [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) at the perfect
time: I'd been working with *Go/Golang* for a couple of months - following YEARS of PHP -, and I was looking for
something to develop my skills.

I tried to approach each challenge in the following way:

- Test-driven as much as possible
- Take every opportunity to learn more Golang (rather than trying to crack the challenge in the shortest possible time)


In most cases, there isn't a **main()** function - the challenge answers are "confirmed" by running the tests.
