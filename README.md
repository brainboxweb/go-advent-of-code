Advent of Code - 2015
===


I came across [Eric Wastl's](http://was.tl/) rather wonderful [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) at the perfect
time: I'd been working with *Go/Golang* for a couple of months (following YEARS of PHP) and I was looking for
something to develop my skills.

I approached the challenge in the following way:

- Test-driven as much as possible
- Take every opportunity to learn more Golang (rather than trying to crack the challenge in the shortest possible time)



Updates in 2025
---

- Moved each day into a separate package. (everything in `main` previously.)
- Some logic moved to obects (Day 5).
